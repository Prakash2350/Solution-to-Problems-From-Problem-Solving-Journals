# Solution to Problems from Problem Solving Journals

This repository contains solutions to problems from various problem-solving journals, such as *Crux Mathematicorum* and *School Science and Math Journal(SSMJ)*, along with proposed problems and related mathematical work.

## About

In this repository, I, Prakash Pant, will upload my solutions to problems from renowned mathematical journals. These solutions cover a range of topics, including inequalities, integrals, and other advanced mathematical concepts. Some of the solutions are also based on problems Iâ€™ve proposed for these journals. 

The solutions are mostly written in LaTeX for clarity and presentation, ensuring that the steps taken in solving the problems are easy to follow and well-organized.

## Content

The repository includes the following types of documents:

- **Problem Solutions**: Detailed step-by-step solutions to problems from *Crux Mathematicorum*, *School Science and Math Journal(SSMJ)*, and other journals.
- **Proposed Problems**: Problems I have proposed for publication in various mathematical journals.
- **Mathematical Papers**: Additional work or papers that expand on problem-solving strategies.

The documents are available in both PDF and LaTeX (.tex) formats for your convenience.
