\textbf{4866.} Find all functions f:$\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that the equation
\[ f(xy+f(f(y)))=xf(y)+y \] holds for all real numbers x and y. \\
										\]
\textit{Solution:}
Let P(x,y) be the stated property.
Let f(1)=A and f(f(1))=B. 
P(x,1) : \[ f(x\times 1+f(f(1)))=xf(1)+1 \]
\[ f(x+A))=Bx+1 \]
which concludes that f(x) is linear. Thus, say f(x) = kx+c.  \\
Substituting it back in the original functional equation, we obtain \\
\[kxy+k^3y+k^2c+kc+c = kxy+xc+y \]
Comparing the coefficient of x, y, xy and constant term, we get \\
\[k=1,  c=0 \]
Thus, the only solution is f(x)=x which clearly satisfies.
